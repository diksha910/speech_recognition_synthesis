1.HTML Structure:
The paragraphs and buttons are structured to ask two questions: "Who is eating a carrot?" and "What is the rabbit eating?"
Each question is paired with a button to trigger the question and a span to display the user's response.

2.JavaScript:
The askQuestion function now accepts a second parameter, responseElementId, to specify which element will display the recorded answer.
The recognition.onresult event handler updates the specified element with the recognized speech.

3.CSS:
Styled to ensure a pleasant visual presentation of the content and buttons.

This code should fulfill the requirements of narrating the story, asking questions both in text and voice, recording the user's answers, and displaying those answers. To test this, save the code as an HTML file and open it in a modern web browser that supports the Web Speech API (such as Google Chrome).
